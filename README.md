# Lab 04 — Ignition file-based deploy

Day 2 (afternoon) of the [CI/CD for Ignition Masterclass](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-masterclass).

> Decode the Ignition 8.3 file structure, then build a file-based deploy pipeline that promotes project changes from a local working gateway, through a dev environment on push to `develop`, to a prod environment on a tag release cut from `main` — all with a hot scan, no gateway restarts. The pipeline follows **Git Flow**.

This is the **first lab where Ignition shows up**. Labs 01–03 deliberately stayed on a generic Python stack so we could teach Git, branching, PRs, linters, and GitHub Actions without the Ignition file format adding noise. The plumbing is solid; now we point it at three real gateways that simulate a local → dev → prod promotion flow.

Block C (image-based deploys) lives in [`cicd-lab-05-ignition-image-based-deploy`](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-05-ignition-image-based-deploy). Block D (multi-gateway) lives in [`cicd-lab-06-multi-gateway-deploy`](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-06-multi-gateway-deploy).

## Prerequisites

- A fork of this repo (the self-hosted runner registers against your fork, not the upstream)
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope — the runner uses it to auto-register itself; never leaves your `.env`
- **≥ 8 GB free RAM for Docker** — three Ignition gateways each cap at 1 GB, plus TimescaleDB, the runner, and the usual Docker Desktop overhead
- _Optional but recommended:_ pass [`cicd-preflight`](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-preflight) so unrelated env issues don't bite you mid-lab
- _Background reading:_ [Lab 03](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-03-github-actions) covers the GitHub Actions fundamentals this lab builds on, but this lab stands alone — the self-hosted runner ships in `docker-compose.yaml`, no manual `docker run` of `myoung34/github-runner` required

## Quick start

```bash
gh repo clone mustry-academy/cicd-lab-04-ignition-file-based-deploy
cd cicd-lab-04-ignition-file-based-deploy
cp .env.example .env
scripts/setup.sh    # brings up the stack, waits for all three gateways, prints credentials
```

Once setup finishes you have three Ignition gateways:

| Gateway | URL | Source of project files |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | http://localhost:8088 | Bind-mounted from `./projects/` and `./services/config/` — edits show up immediately |
| `dev` | http://localhost:8089 | Empty until `deploy.yml` runs on push to `develop` |
| `prod` | http://localhost:8090 | Empty until `release.yml` runs on tag push `v*` (cut from `main`) |

Login to any of them with the credentials from `.env` (`GATEWAY_ADMIN_USERNAME_LOCAL/_DEV/_PROD`, default `admin / lab04password`).

> **Trial mode:** each gateway runs in 2-hour trial mode. Reset via *Gateway → Config → Licensing → Reset Trial* — unlimited and entirely legal for development. You'll do this **three times** if you keep all three gateways up long enough.

> **Stuck?** See [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the common stack / runner / deploy failures and their fixes. Before opening a PR, run `scripts/validate.sh` (mirrors CI).

## Lab structure

The lab is one exercise in two ordered parts — see [`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md):

1. **Ignition 8.3 file structure decoded** — know every file in `data/`: what it is, who owns it, whether it belongs in git.
2. **File-based deploy mechanic** — ship project changes local → dev → prod, hot scan, no restarts.

> Image-based deploys and multi-gateway coordination come next, on Day 3, in separate labs ([image-based](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-05-ignition-image-based-deploy), [multi-gateway](https://github.com/mustry-academy/cicd-lab-06-multi-gateway-deploy)).

## The Compose stack

Three Ignition 8.3 gateways + one TimescaleDB. The three gateways simulate the classic local → dev → prod promotion:

- **`ignition-local`** bind-mounts `./projects/` and `./services/config/` from the host. Anything you write into those paths on your laptop is *immediately on disk* inside the local gateway. Hit `scripts/trigger-scan.sh both` to make the gateway notice. That's the tight inner feedback loop.
- **`ignition-dev`** uses a named volume (not a bind mount). It starts empty; the deploy workflow (`deploy.yml`) `docker cp`s the working tree into the container and triggers a scan. Mirrors how a real shared dev environment gets fed by CI.
- **`ignition-prod`** is the same shape as dev, populated by the release workflow (`release.yml`) when you push a tag.

The single TimescaleDB hosts three logical databases (`ignition_loc`, `ignition_dev`, `ignition_prd`) so each gateway can have its own historian data without crosstalk.

Memory is set to 1 GB per gateway via Compose limits. Tight but workable; bump it in `docker-compose.yaml` if you see GC pauses.

## Branching model (Git Flow)

This lab uses **Git Flow**: two long-lived branches map to the two deployed gateways.

```
feature/*  ─┐
            ├─PR→  develop ──push→  deploy.yml ──docker cp + scan──→ DEV gateway
hotfix/* ─┐ │
          │ └── release/* ─PR→ main ──tag vX.Y.Z→ release.yml ──docker cp + scan──→ PROD gateway
          └────────────────────────┘
```

| Branch | Role | What CWe-does |
|---|---|---|
| `develop` | Integration — feature branches merge here | `deploy.yml` ships the working tree to the **dev** gateway |
| `main` | Release-ready — only `release/*` and `hotfix/*` merge here | nothing on its own; you **tag** `vX.Y.Z` to release |
| `feature/*` | Day-to-day work, branched off `develop` | `ci.yml` validates the PR into `develop` |
| `release/*` / `hotfix/*` | Stabilize a release / urgent fix, merged into `main` (and back to `develop`) | `ci.yml` validates the PR into `main` |

The `release/*` branch is your **freeze point**: cut it when `develop` is exactly what you want in prod, merge it into `main`, and tag. The tag — not the merge — is what `release.yml` ships, so prod always runs a named, re-deployable version.

> **Setup:** Git Flow needs a `develop` branch. Create it once in your fork
> (`git checkout -b develop && git push -u origin develop`) and, optionally, set it as the fork's
> **default branch** (*Settings → Branches*) so feature PRs target it by default.

## A note on the CI/CD workflows

Three workflows under [`.github/workflows/`](./.github/workflows/):

| File | Trigger | Runner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) | PR to `develop` or `main` | `ubuntu-latest` (free) | Validate JSON, `.deployignore` syntax, and the workflow files themselves. |
| [`deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) | Push to `develop` (deploy paths only), manual | `[self-hosted, lab04]` | File-based deploy to the **dev** gateway via `docker cp`. |
| [`release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml) | Tag `v*` (on `main`), manual | `[self-hosted, lab04]` | File-based deploy to the **prod** gateway. Same mechanics, different environment. |

> `deploy.yml` has a `paths:` filter (`projects/**`, `services/config/**`, `.deployignore`, `scripts/trigger-scan.sh`, `scripts/lib.sh`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`), so a push to `develop` that only touches docs or the README does **not** trigger a deploy — edit project or config content to see it fire.

Both deploy workflows need:

- The bundled self-hosted runner (`github-runner` service in `docker-compose.yaml`) registered against your fork with the `lab04` label. It auto-registers using `RUNNER_GITHUB_PAT` from `.env` and shares the host's Docker daemon (mounted `/var/run/docker.sock`) so the workflows can `docker cp` files into the dev/prod gateway containers. If you'd rather use your own runner instead, set `runner.labels` to include `lab04` and skip the bundled service.
- A GitHub **environment** per workflow with the right secret + variables:

| Scope | Name | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment `lab-gateway-dev` (deploy.yml) | `IGNITION_API_KEY` | Secret | Token from the dev gateway with Project Scan + Config Scan permission |
| Environment `lab-gateway-dev` | `IGNITION_URL` | Variable (optional) | Defaults to `http://ignition-dev:8088` (bundled-runner case). Override to `http://localhost:8089` if your runner is on the host. |
| Environment `lab-gateway-dev` | `IGNITION_CONTAINER` | Variable (optional) | Defaults to `lab04-ignition-dev` |
| Environment `lab-gateway-prod` (release.yml) | (same three) | | Defaults: URL `http://ignition-prod:8088`, container `lab04-ignition-prod` |

Add **required reviewers** on the `lab-gateway-prod` environment if you want a manual approval gate on tag releases — common pattern, no workflow change required.

The deploy part of [`exercises/lab.md`](./exercises/lab.md) walks through the end-to-end setup.
